Hey!

To apply cool and amazing filters to your images follow the steps:

1) Download the folder.
2) Now add the images you want to apply filters to in the Images folder. Make sure to convert to 24-bit .bmp file before putting in the folder.
3) Put the name of the images without .bmp extension in the ImageList.txt file. Add each name on a separate line.
4) Run the following commands in the linux terminal to apply all the filters to your files.
   $make -f Image_makefile
   $./Image_executable
 
5) All your edited images have been saved in the respective folder in Images_copy.

Have fun!!!
